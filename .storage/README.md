# Storage

This directory contains storage of large segments of past code, particularly for the case in which I realize that 
I actually need a prior implementation, so that I have an easily accessible location to gather it from.

The base name of each file (e.g. `nations.py` would have a base name of `nations`) corresponds to the research directory
where the code is gathered from, and there are comments before each code snippet which refer to the specific file where they are from.
